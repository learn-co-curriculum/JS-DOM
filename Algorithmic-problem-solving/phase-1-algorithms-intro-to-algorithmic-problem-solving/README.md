# Introduction to Algorithmic Problem Solving

## Learning Goals

- Understand what you will learn in this section

## Introduction

Welcome to this section on algorithmic problem solving! From Software
Engineering Prep up to this point, you've learned the fundamentals of JavaScript
as a language, including how to write functions and work with built-in data types,
as well as how to use the "three pillars" of JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event
Handling, and Network Communication) to build small web applications.

In this section, we're going to shift gears a bit and leave the browser to focus
on one of the most important skills you can build as a software engineer:
developing a **process** for solving problems with code.

Developing your algorithmic problem solving skills will help you approach labs,
code challenges and projects throughout the rest of this program. Just as
importantly, it will also help immensely as you begin to prepare for technical
interviews once you graduate the program! One of the most critical steps toward
landing a job after graduating is being able to demonstrate your proficiency
writing code during technical interviews, and having a rock-solid problem
solving process in place will give you much more confidence when confronted with
a new problem.

The objectives for this section are to:

- Define what "algorithm" means
- Develop a process for algorithmic problem solving
- Understand the usefulness of Big O notation
- Identify the Big O time and space complexity of a given algorithm
- Recognize common Big O runtimes: constant, logarithmic, linear, and quadratic

By the end of this section, you'll have a strong foundation in the skills needed
to solve many data structures and algorithm problems. Later in the program,
we'll revisit this material and move on to more advanced topics.
