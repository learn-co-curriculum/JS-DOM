# Big O Notation

## Learning Goals

- Define Big O notation
- Calculate time and space complexity using Big O notation

## Introduction

Big O notation is one of the most important concepts to understand when it comes
to writing and analyzing the performance of algorithms. In any algorithm
interview problem you're given, there's an extremely high chance that your
interviewer will ask you to identify the time complexity (and possibly the space
complexity) of your solution using Big O notation. In this lesson, we'll discuss
what Big O notation is and how to determine the Big O of any given algorithm
with a few simple steps.

## Defining Big O

Big O can sound like an intimidating term, but it's incredibly useful — and it's
very likely that you already have an intuitive sense of how it works! Let's
start with a definition:

What does that mean? We'll use a real-world example. Imagine you're looking for
a sock in a pile of unfolded laundry. An algorithm for finding the sock might
look like this:

```txt
take one item from the pile
check if it's the sock we're looking for
if it is
  put on the sock
otherwise, keep looking
```

How much time will it take us to find the sock? Well, that depends on a couple
factors.

One factor to consider is how quickly we're able to pull out socks from the pile
and check what they look like. That variable changes from person to person, so
it's not a factor of our _algorithm's_ efficiency, and not something we can
account for in Big O notation.

The other factor to consider is the size of our input, or in this case, how big
is the pile of laundry? If it's just one item, we'll find the sock right away!
If it's 1000 items, the **worst case** scenario is that the sock we're looking
for is the last one we'll pull out of the pile. So, for our sock finding
algorithm, **as the size of the input increases, the time requirement increases
linearly** (the bigger the pile, the longer it takes).

Let's translate this analogy to code:

```js
function findSock(laundry) {
  for (const item of laundry) {
    if (item === "sock") return item;
  }
}

findSock(["shirt", "shorts", "sock", "pants"]);
```

Let's think about the time complexity of this algorithm (how long it will take
to run) step by step:

- The `for...of` block will iterate over every element in the `laundry` array.
- On the first iteration, the first element, `"shirt"` is assigned to the
  variable `item`.
- The `if` statement checks: is the `item` a `"sock"`? Nope! We continue
  iterating.
- On the second iteration, the second element, `"shorts"` is assigned to the
  variable `item`.
- The `if` statement checks: is the `item` a `"sock"`? Nope! We continue
  iterating.
- On the third iteration, the third element, `"sock"` is assigned to the
  variable `item`.
- The `if` statement checks: is the `item` a `"sock"`? Yep! We stop iterating
  and return from the function.

What happens if our sock is the last element of the array? Or what if the sock
isn't in the array at all?

If `laundry` is an unsorted array of strings, the **worst case** scenario for
our algorithm is that it will have to iterate over every item in the array. In
regards to Big O, whether it might find the element on the first try, or on the
third try, or sometimes not at all is not important; developers simply care
about describing the algorithm from the highest, most abstract level.

Besides the size of the input, the other factor that will determine how long our
algorithm will take to find a sock is how powerful the computer is that is
running our code. Once again, that variable changes from computer to computer,
so it's not a factor of our algorithm's efficiency.

Therefore, we can summarize the time complexity of our function like this:

**Given an input array of `n` elements, the worst case scenario is that the
algorithm needs to make `n` iterations.**

In Big O notation, we can express this as `O(n)`, which is also known as
**linear time**.

## Identifying Time Complexity With Big O

When calculating the time complexity of an algorithm using Big O notation, we're
looking for a high-level summary of the algorithm's performance. Let's look at
another example of an algorithm. This one calculates the average of an array of
numbers:

```js
function average(array) {
  let total = 0;
  for (const num of array) {
    total += num;
  }
  return total / array.length;
}
```

To determine the time complexity of any algorithm, all we need to do is:

- Count the number of steps the computer will take to run our code
- Remove any constants (more on this shortly!)

Let's start by counting the steps:

```js
function average(array) {
  // 1 step
  let total = 0;

  for (const num of array) {
    // n steps (dependent on the size of the array)
    total += num;
  }

  // 1 step
  return total / array.length;
}
```

This gives us a runtime of `O(n + 2)`. We can remove the constants (`+ 2`)
because we're just looking for a high-level summary, so we end up with `O(n)`.

What if we use the `reduce` method instead of a `for...of` loop?

```js
function average(array) {
  return array.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0) / array.length;
}
```

Under the hood, the `reduce` method still needs to iterate over every element in
the array, so we still end up with the same runtime: `O(n)`. It's important to
keep this in mind for built-in methods: just because we might end up with fewer
lines of code doesn't mean our runtime improves.

Let's try another example. Here's another algorithm for determining if an array
contains the average of all its values:

```js
function containsAverage(array) {
  const averageValue = average(array);
  for (const num of array) {
    if (num === averageValue) return true;
  }
}
```

Let's count the steps once more:

```js
function containsAverage(array) {
  // n steps (depending on the size of the array)
  const averageValue = average(array);

  for (const num of array) {
    // n steps (depending on the size of the array)
    if (num === averageValue) return true;
  }
}
```

Counting the steps here, we end up with `O(n * 2)`. Even though it takes twice
as long as our first algorithm, we can still remove the constants and end up
with `O(n)`. Since we're looking for a high-level summary, this approximation
still gives us a good sense as to how well our algorithm will scale to larger
and larger inputs when compared to some other common Big O runtimes.

## Space Complexity With Big O

We've spent some time discussing how to calculate time complexity (how long
our function will take to run) using Big O notation, but there's another
consideration: space complexity (how much memory our function will use).

Just like with time complexity, we measure space complexity _relative to the
size of the input_: for an input that takes up `n` memory, how much memory will
our algorithm use? In addition to the amount of memory needed for our inputs, we
need to consider what auxiliary (additional) space is taken up for new data
structures when our algorithm runs.

Let's break down a couple algorithms to see some examples:

```js
function reverseString(word) {
  const wordArray = word.split("");
  const reversedWordArray = wordArray.reverse();
  const reversedWord = reversedWordArray.join("");
  return reversedWord;
}
```

In this case, we need to allocate memory for the input `word`, as well as these
auxiliary pieces of data:

- an array `wordArray` that will grow in size linearly with the input
- an array `reversedWordArray` that will grow in size linearly with the input
- a string `reversedWord` that will grow in size linearly with the input

Putting that together, we end up with `O(4n)` space complexity: for an input
string of length `n`, we also need to declare two arrays of length `n` and
another string of length `n`. We can simplify as `O(n)` after dropping the
constant.

In general, space complexity can be a bit more difficult to calculate than time
complexity because it can vary between different programming languages and
environments, depending on how they allocate memory under the hood; so again,
keeping a high-level summary is more important than trying to be too precise.

For a function that simply adds two numbers together:

```js
function sum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

We only allocate memory for the inputs and the return value:

- A number `num1`
- A number `num2`
- A number (the return value)

In this case, we can summarize the space complexity as constant: `O(1)`.

In many cases, you can improve an algorithm's space complexity by sacrificing
its time complexity, and vice-versa; navigating these tradeoffs is one of the
keys to being a good developer, and it comes with practice.

## Conclusion

To recap:

- **Big O notation** is used to classify algorithms according to how their run
  time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
- To calculate the time complexity of an algorithm using Big O notation, count
  the number of steps the computer will take to run our code and then remove any
  constants (so `O(2n + 1)` becomes just `O(n)`).
- To calculate the space complexity of an algorithm using Big O notation, check
  what memory is needed for the inputs as well as any auxiliary data structures
  (and also remove any constants).

In the next lesson, we'll look at some other examples of algorithms that use
other common Big O formulas.
